Curate two datasets\n","* A concept dataset that represents concept C\n","* A random dataset\n","\n","2.

Given an image input 𝑥, we can measure its conceptual sensitivity by calculating the directional derivative of the prediction in the direction of the unit CAV\n","\n","**In Practice**\n","\n","Instead of training only one CAV, we train multiple CAVs using different random datasets while keeping the concept dataset the same.

Tensors from the graph: bottleneck tensors and ends\n","* Store your bottleneck tensors in `self.bottlenecks_tensors` as a dictionary. Only include bottlenecks that you are interested in running TCAV with.\n","* Similarly, fill in `self.ends` dictionary with `input`, `logit` and `prediction` tensors.\n","\n","### 2. Define loss\n","Assign your loss tensor to `self.loss`. This is what TCAV uses to take directional derivatives.\n","\n","Set a tensorflow placeholder for the target index in the logit layer (e.g., 0 index for a dog, 1 for a cat):\n","\n","```python\n","self.y_input\n","```\n","Here is an example of multi-class classification:\n","\n","```python\n","self.y_input = tf.placeholder(tf.int64, shape=[None])\n","```\n","\n","The original authors provide the following code for a multiclass classifier:\n","\n","```python\n","    # Construct gradient ops.\n","    with g.as_default():\n","      self.y_input = tf.placeholder(tf.int64, shape=[None])\n","\n","      self.pred = tf.expand_dims(self.ends['prediction'][0], 0)\n","\n","      self.loss = tf.reduce_mean(\n","          tf.nn.softmax_cross_entropy_with_logits(\n","              labels=tf.one_hot(self.y_input, len(self.labels)),\n","              logits=self.pred))\n","    self._make_gradient_tensors()\n","```\n","\n","### 3. Call _make_gradient_tensors in __init__() of your wrapper\n","\n","Given the loss and bottleneck tensors defined above, this function adds gradient tensors:\n","\n","```python\n","_make_gradient_tensors()  \n","```\n","\n","\n","### 4. Fill in labels, image shapes and a model name.\n","Get the mapping from labels (strings) to indice in the logit layer (int) in a dictionary format:\n","\n","```python\n","def id_to_label(self, idx)\n","def label_to_id(self, label)\n","```\n","\n","* Set your input image shape at  `self.image_shape`\n","* Set your model name to `self.model_name`\n","\n","### 5. Implement a class that returns activations\n","\n","* Implement a class of the ActivationGenerationInterface which TCAV uses to load example data for a given concept or target, call into your model wrapper and return activations. You can cache your activations and/or parallelize your computations (examples: `ActivationGeneratorBase.process_and_load_activations` in `activation_generator.py`).\n","\n","* The `process_and_load_activations` method of the activation generator must return a dictionary of activations that has concept or target name as  a first key, and the bottleneck name as a second key. Example:\n","\n","```python\n","{concept1: {bottleneck1: [[0.2, 0.1, ....]]},\n","concept2: {bottleneck1: [[0.1, 0.02, ....]]},\n","target1: {bottleneck1: [[0.02, 0.99, ....]]}\n","```"]}],"metadata":{"colab":{"authorship_tag":"ABX9TyPEyvcrFTQPnDRFBbyci087","provenance":[]},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"name":"python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}
